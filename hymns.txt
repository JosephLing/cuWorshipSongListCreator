Amazing Grace
And Can It Be
Be Thou my Vision
Because He Lives
Before the Throne
Blessed Assurance
Come Thou Fount
Crown him with many crowns
Glorify Thy Name
Great is thy faithfulness
Hallelujah, what a Saviour
He is Exalted
Holy and anointed one
Holy, Holy, Holy
How Deep the Fathers Love
How Great Thou Art
How Marvellous
In Christ Alone
I Surrender All
Jesus Paid it all
â€˜tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
There is a Redeemer
The Power of the cross
Thine Be The Glory
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
O Lord Your Beautiful
Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord
Shine Jesus Shine
When I Survey
