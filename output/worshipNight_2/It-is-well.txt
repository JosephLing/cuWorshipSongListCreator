Verse 1
When peace, like a river
attendeth my way
When sorrows like
sea billows roll
Whatever my lot
Thou has taught me to say
It is well, it is well,     with my soul

Chorus
It is well,   It is well
with my soul, with my soul
It is well,   it is well,
with my soul  (Gm)
(Gm 4th time only)

Verse 2
My sin oh, the bliss
of this glorious thought
My sin, not in part but the whole
Was nailed to the cross
and I bear it no more
Praise the Lord
praise the Lord,   O my soul

Bridge
We sing holy, holy, holy
We sing holy, holy, holy
And we sing holy is your name
Lord most high

Verse 3
Lord, haste the day
when my faith shall be sight
The clouds be
rolled back
as a scroll
The trump shall resound
and the Lord shall descend
Even so, it is well  with my soul
