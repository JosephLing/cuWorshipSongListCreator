There's nothing worth more, that will ever come close

I've tasted and seen, of the sweetest of loves
Where my heart becomes free, and my shame is undone
In Your Presence Lord

Holy Spirit You are welcome here
Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere
Your Glory God is what our hearts long for
To be overcome by Your Presence Lord

Let us experience the Glory of Your Goodness
