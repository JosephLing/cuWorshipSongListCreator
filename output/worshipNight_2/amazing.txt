Verse 1
A love so undeserved, a gift that's free,
You lavish on me.
A peace I could not earn,
and mercy for the freedom of my soul.

Chorus
That's what's so amazing about Your grace.
That's what's so amazing about Your grace.
Lord, every day You pour on me
Your blessings of eternity,
and that's what's so amazing about Your grace.

Verse 2
Forgiveness runs so deep within Your heart
of loving kindness;
and, should a soul forget,
the cross of Christ reminds us every day.

Bridge
Freely I've received, now freely to give.
Freely I've received, now freely to give.
Freely I've received, now freely to give,
give my life to You.
