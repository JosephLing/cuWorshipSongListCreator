Verse 1
Oh to see the dawn of the darkest day
Christ on the road to cal  -  va  -  ry  
Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten then
Nailed to a cross of    wood  

Chorus 1
This the pow'r of the cross 
Christ became sin for us 
Took the blame, bore the wrath 
We  stand forgiven at       the cross 

Verse 2
Oh to see the pain written on Your face 
Bearing the awesome weight of sin 
Ev'ry bitter thought, ev'ry evil deed 
Crowning Your blood - stained brow 

(REPEAT CHORUS)

Verse 3
Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath 
Quakes as its maker bows his head 
Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life
'Finished!' the vict'ry cry

Verse 4
Oh to see my name written in the wound 
For through Your suf'ering I am free 
Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live 
Won through Your selfless love 

Chorus 2
This the pow'r of the cross 
Son of God slain for us 
What a life, what a cost 
We  stand forgiven at       the cross
