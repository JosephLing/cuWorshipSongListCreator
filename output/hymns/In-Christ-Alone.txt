Verse 1
In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
this cornerstone, this solid ground
firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

Verse 2
There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
then, bursting forth in glorious day
up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in vic-tory
sin's curse has lost its grip on me
for I am His and He is mine
bought with the precious blood of Christ

Verse 3
No guilt in life, no fear in death
this is the pow'r of Christ in me
from life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man
can ever pluck me from His hand
'til He returns or calls me home
here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand

Bridge
I find my strength, I find my hope
I find my help in Christ alone
When fear assails, when darkness falls
I find my peace in Christ alone

I give my life,  I give my all
I sing my song  to Christ alone
The King of kings,  the Lord I love
All heaven sings  to Christ alone

Verse 4
Til He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
Here in the power of Christ we stand
