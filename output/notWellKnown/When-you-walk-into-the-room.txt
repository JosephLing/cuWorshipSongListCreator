Verse 1
When you walk into the room
Everything changes
Darkness starts to tremble
At the light that you bring
And when you walk into the room
Every heart starts burning
And nothing matters more
Than just to sit here at your feet
And worship you
We worship you

Chorus
We love you
We'll never stop
We can't live without you, Jesus
We love you
And we can't get enough
All this is for you, Jesus

Verse 2
When you walk into the room
Sickness starts to vanish
Every hopeless situation ceases to exist
And when you walk into the room,
The dead begin to rise
'Cause there is resurrection life
In all You do

Bridge
Come and consume, God
All we are
We give you permission
Our hearts are Yours
We want You
We want You
