Verse 1
When I walk through  deep waters
I know that You will be with me
When I'm standing in the fire
I will not be overcome
Through the valley of the shad - ow
I will not fear

Chorus
I am not alone
I am not alone
You will go before me
You will never leave me

Verse 2
In the midst of deep sorrow
I see Your light is breaking through
The dark of night will not overtake me
I am pressing into You
Lord, You fight my every battle
And I will not fear

Bridge
You a - maze me, redeem me
You call me as Your own

Verse 3
You're my strength
You're my defender
You're my refuge in the storm
Through these trials
You've always been faithful
You bring healing to my soul
