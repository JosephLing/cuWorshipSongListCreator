Verse 1
Your love has opened my eyes
In You I have come alive
A new day has come
Your grace has turned me around
Set my feet on solid ground
A new day has come

Chorus
It's a new day it's a new life
It's a new start for every heart that's found You
Jesus we've found You
New hope full of Your joy
It's a new start for every heart that's found You
Jesus we found You

Verse 2
We have been healed and restored
Everything we are is Yours
We'll shine for You
We'll sing it loud, sing it strong
Telling of the Father's love
We'll shine for You

Bridge
Lead the way
You lead me in Your perfect ways
I'm not afraid You're with me
Light the way
With You is it a brighter day
I'm not afraid You're with me
