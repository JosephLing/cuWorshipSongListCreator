Intro


Verse 1
I stand before You, awed by Your majesty
Covered by Your mercy, Your blood has made me free
Draw me to You, and set my heart on fire
I want to know You. You're my one desire

Chorus 1
I give You my worship, all of my passion
I give You my whole heart, all my devotion

Verse 2
Grace never ending, Your hands that carry me
Your body it was broken for all the world to see
My heart is held by love so unconditional
You captivate me. You're the lover of my soul

Chorus 2
Here I will bow down and say that I need You
Here I will worship, say that I love You
Oh how I love You! Oh how I love You!
Oh how I love You! Oh how I love You, oh!

Bridge
I want to know You. Let your Spirit overwhelm me.
Let Your presence overtake my heart  | 2x

Chorus 2
