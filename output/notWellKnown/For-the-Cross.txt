Chorus
And I love You for the cross
I'm overwhelmed by the mystery
I love You for the cost
That Jesus You would do this for me
When You were broken You were beaten
You were punished I go free
When You were wounded and rejected
In Your mercy I am healed

Verse 1
I will love You for the cross
And I will love You for the cost
Man of sufferings
Bringer of my peace

Verse 2
You came into a world of shame
And paid the price we could not pay
Death that brought me life
Blood that brought me home
Death that brought me life
Blood that brought me home

Verse 3
Jesus Christ the sinner's friend
Does this kindness know no bounds
With Your precious blood
You have purchased me

Verse 4
O the myst'ry of the cross
You were punished You were crushed
But that punishment has become my peace
Yes that punishment has become my peace
