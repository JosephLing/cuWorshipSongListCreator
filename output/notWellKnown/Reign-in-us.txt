Verse 1
You thought of us before the world began  
to breathe
You knew our names before we came to be  
You saw the very day we'd fall away from you  
And how desperately we need to be 
redeemed  
Lord Jesus, come lead us  
We're desperate for your touch  

Chorus
Oh great and mighty One
With one desire we come
That you,  would reign
That you would reign in us
We're offering up our lives
a living sacrifice
That you,    would reign
That you would reign in us  

Verse 2
Spirit of the living God fall fresh again 
Come search our hearts and purify our lives  
G/B      Am7                                                        
We need your perfect we need your 
Fmaj7   
discipline
We're lost unless you guide us with your light
Lord, Jesus, come lead us  
We're desperate for your touch

(REPEAT CHORUS)

Bridge 1
We cry out for Your life to refine us  
Cry out, for Your love to define us  
Cry out, for Your mercy to keep us  
Blameless until You return.  

(REPEAT CHORUS TWICE)
