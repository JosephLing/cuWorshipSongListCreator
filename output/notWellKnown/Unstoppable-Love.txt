Intro


Verse 1
Try to stop Your love, and You would wage a war
Try to take the very thing You gave Your life for
And You would come running; tear down every wall
All the while shouting, My love you're worth it all!

Chorus
God You pursue me with power and glory
unstoppable love that never ends
You're unrelenting with passion and mercy
Unstoppable love that never ends

Verse 2
You broke into the silence and sang a song of hope
A melody resounding in the deep of my soul
You have come running; You tore down every wall
All the while shouting, My love you're worth it all!

Chorus

Bridge
No sin, no shame, no past, no pain
can separate me from Your love
No height, no depth, no fear, no death
can separate me from Your love. 
2x

Chorus
