    Verse 1
Standing here in Your presence
In a grace so relentless
I am won by perfect love
Wrapped within the arms of heaven
In a peace that lasts forever
Sinking deep in mercy's sea
---
Chorus
I'm wide awake
drawing close stirred by grace
And all my heart is Yours
All fear removed
I breathe You in I lean into Your love
Oh Your love
---
Verse 2
When I'm lost You pursue me
Lift my head to see Your glory
Lord of all so beautiful
Here in You I find shelter
Captivated by the splendour of Your face
My secret place
---
Bridge
Your love so deep is washing over me
Your face is all I seek You are my ev'rything
Jesus Christ You are my one desire
Lord hear my only cry to know You all my life
