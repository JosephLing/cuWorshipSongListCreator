You are the highest
You are the greatest
You are the Lord of all

To sing the new eternal song
And crown Him King of Glory now
Confess Him Lord of all

A day will come when all will sing
And glorify our matchless King
Your Name unrivaled stands alone
You are the Lord of all

Oh let ev'ry heart

Let ev'ry heart
Let ev'ry tongue
Sing sing sing
