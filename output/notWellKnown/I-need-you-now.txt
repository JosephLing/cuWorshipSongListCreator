Verse 1
On this thirsty desert ground
In a dry and barren land I bow down  
I need You now 
You are calling I will come
To Your river I will run I bow down  
I need You now 

Chorus
O Living Water O God my Savior  
If I ever needed You I need You now  
O Living Water O God my Healer  
If I ever needed You I need You now  

Verse 2
You're the start and You're the end
You complete what You begin I bow down
I need You now
You are calling I will come
To Your river I will run I bow down
I need You now

Bridge
Just like the desert needs the blessing of the rain  
Just like the winter waiting for the sun again  
I need You now  

Just like a river as it reaches for the sea
Just like a song it needs the sound of melody
I need You now
God I need You now
If I ever needed You I need You now
Just like the desert needs the blessing of the rain
Just like the winter waiting for the sun again
I need You now
