Verse 1
Your cross, Your cross
It draws me to Your heart
It makes my spirit sing
It makes my spirit sing
Your grace, Your grace
O I hear it call my name
I'm waking up to sing
I'm waking up to sing

Chorus
We will  sing and  shout
Sing and shout
Open up our hearts and pour Your praises out
We will  sing and  shout
Sing and shout
Open up our hearts and pour Your praises out

Verse 2
Because, because
Because Your love came down
It makes me want to sing
It makes me want to sing
Because, because
Because You called my name
I'm waking up to sing
I'm waking up to sing

Bridge
What could be better than a grace
That washes all our shame away?
What could be better than Your great love?
What could be better than a grace
That leads us home and makes a way?
What could be better than Your great love?
