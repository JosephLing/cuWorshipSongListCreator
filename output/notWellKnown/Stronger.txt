Intro

Verse 1
There is Love that came for us
Humbled to a sinner's cross
You broke my shame and sinfulness
You rose again victorious

Verse 2
Faithfulness none can deny
Through the storm and through the fire
There is truth that sets me free
Jesus Christ who lives in me

Chorus
You are stronger
You are stronger
Sin is broken
You have saved me
It is written
Christ is risen
Jesus You are Lord of all

Verse 3
No beginning and no end
You're my hope and my defense
You came to seek and save the lost
You paid it all upon the cross

Bridge
So let Your Name be lifted higher
Be lifted higher
Be lifted higher
(Repeat 3X)
