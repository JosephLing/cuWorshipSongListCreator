Verse 1
When I call on Your Name You answer
When I fall You are there by my side
You delivered me out of darkness
Now I stand in the hope of new life

Pre-Chorus
By grace I'm free You rescued me
All I am is Yours

Chorus
I've found a Love greater than life itself
I've found a Hope stronger and nothing compares
I once was lost now I'm alive in You

Verse 2
You're my God and my firm Foundation
It is You Whom I'll trust at all times
I give glory and praise adoration
To my Savior Who's seated on high

Bridge
Love came down and rescued me
I thank You  yes I thank You
I once was blind but now I see
I see You  (only the 1st time) yes I see You
(REPEAT)
