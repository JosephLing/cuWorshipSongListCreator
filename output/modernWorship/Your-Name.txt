Verse 1
Your name stronger than I know
Deeper than a thousand words
Could say Your name
Your name, Fire in my soul
Healing for a hurting heart today
Your name Your name
And my heart will bow
And my spirit soar
And my soul cries out
To the Lord of all
To my God and King
To my Prince of Peace
I will lift my voice in praise
unto Your name
Unto Your name

Verse 2
Your name all creation knows
The One who gave it life
With breath alone
Your name
Your name
Glory now displayed
All the earth belongs to You alone to Your name
To Your name
And the mountains bow
And the seas will roar
And the rocks cry out
All creation calls to the Holy One
To the Son of God
We will lift our voice in praise
Worship Your name
Worship Your name

Verse 3
Your name higher than them all
Holy One of God the Lord of lords
Your name Your name
Heaven's only Son
High and lifted up forevermore
Your name Your name
And the nations bow
And their kingdoms fall
Every king and priest
Every prince and lord
Falling to their knees
Will acknowledge You
We will lift our voice in praise
Honor Your name
Honor Your name
