Verse 1
Everyone needs compassion
Love that's never failing
Let mercy fall on me
Everyone needs forgiveness

The kindness of a Savior
The hope of nations

Chorus 1
Savior
He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save
He is mighty to save
Forever
Author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

Verse 2
So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures
Fill my life again
I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in
Now I surrender

Bridge
Shine your light
And let the whole world see
We're sing-ing for the glory
Of the risen King Je- sus
