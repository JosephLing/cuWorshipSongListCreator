Verse 1
Every soul every beating heart
Every nation and every tongue
Come find hope in the
Love of the Father
All creation will bow as one
Lift their eyes see the risen Son
Jesus Savior forever and after

Chorus
This is love
Jesus came and died
And gave His life for us
Let our voices rise
And sing for all He's done
Our fear is overcome
Our God is love
Our God is love

Verse 2
Every distant and broken heart
Every prayer every outstretched arm
Finding hope in the love of the Father
Age to age let His praises rise
All the glory for all of time
Jesus Savior forever and after

Bridge
Age to age
We will be singing
In the light of all He's done
All the earth everyone singing
In the wonder of His love
