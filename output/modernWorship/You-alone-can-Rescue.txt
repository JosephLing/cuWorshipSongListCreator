Verse 1
Who, oh Lord, could save themselves,
Their own sin could heal?
Our shame was deeper than the sea
Your grace is deeper still

Chorus
You alone can rescue, You alone can save
You alone can lift us from the grave
You came down to find us, led us out of death
To You alone belongs the highest praise

Verse 2
You, oh Lord, have made a way
The great divide You healed
For when our hearts were far a-way
Your love went further still
Yes, your love goes further still

Bridge
We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes
You're the Giver of Life
We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes
You're the Giver of Life

Tag
To You alone belongs the highest praise
To You alone belongs the highest praise
