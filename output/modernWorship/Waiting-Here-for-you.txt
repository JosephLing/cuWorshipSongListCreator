Verse 1
If faith can move the mountains
Let the mountains move
We come with expectation                           
Waiting here for You,   waiting here for You

Verse 2
You're the Lord of all creation
And still You know my heart
The Author of Salvation
You've loved us from the start

Chorus
Waiting here for You 
With our hands lifted high  in praise   
And it's You we adore
Singing Alleluia

Verse 3
You are everything You've promised
Your faithfulness is true
And we're desperate for Your presence
All we need is You

Bridge
Singing Alleluia (repeat)

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia
