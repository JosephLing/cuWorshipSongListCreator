Verse 1
Hope is here
Shout the news to everyone
It's a new day peace has come
Jesus saves
Mercy triumphs at the cross
Love has come to rescue us
Jesus saves

Pre-Chorus
Hope is here
What a joyful noise we'll make
As we join with heaven's song

Chorus
To let all the world know that Jesus saves
Raise a shout to let all the world know
That Jesus saves

Verse 2
Free at last
Every debt has been repaid
Broken hearts can be remade
Jesus saves
Sing above the storms of life
Sing it through the darkest night
Jesus saves

Bridge
You save You heal
Restore, reveal, Your Father's heart to us
You rose to raise us from the grave
Your Spirit lives in us
