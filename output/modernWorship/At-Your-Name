The mountains shake and crumble
At Your name
The oceans roar and tumble
At Your name angels will bow
The earth will rejoice
Your people cry out

Lord of all the earth
We'll shout Your name, shout Your name
Filling up the skies
With endless praise, endless praise
Yahweh, Yahweh
We love to shout Your name oh Lord

There is no one like our God
We will sing, we will sing
There is no one like our God
