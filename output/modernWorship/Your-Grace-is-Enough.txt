Verse 1
Great is Your faithfulness Oh God
You wrestle with the sinner's heart
You lead me by still waters into mercy
And nothing can keep us apart

Pre-Chorus
So remember Your people
Remember Your children
Remember Your promise Oh God

Chorus 1
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me

Verse 2
Great is Your love and justice God
You use the weak to lead the strong
You lead us in the song of your salvation
And all Your people sing along
