Verse 1
Wonderful, so wonderful is Your unfailing love
Your cross has spoken mercy over me
No eye has seen, no ear has heard
no heart could fully know
how glorious, how beautiful You are

Chorus
Beautiful One I love, beautiful One I adore
beautiful One my soul must sing

Verse 2
Powerful, so powerful, Your glory fills the skies
Your mighty works displayed for all to see
The beauty of Your majesty
awakes my heart to sing
How marvelous, how wonderful You are

Bridge
You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew
You captured my heart with this love
'cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as You

Ending
My soul, my soul must sing
My soul, my soul must sing
My soul, my soul must sing
Beautiful One
