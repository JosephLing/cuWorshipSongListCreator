Verse
Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
and I will open up my heart
and let the Healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth
and I will daily lift my hands
for I will always sing
of when Your love came down

Chorus
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your  love forever

Bridge
Oh, I feel like dancing
it's foolishness, I know
But when the world has seen the light
they will dance with joy like we're dancing now
