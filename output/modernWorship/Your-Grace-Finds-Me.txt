Verse 1
It's there in the newborn cry
There in the light of every sunrise
There in the shadows of this life
Your great grace

Verse 2
It's there on the mountain top
There in the everyday and the mundane
There in the sorrow and the dancing
Your great grace oh, such grace

Chorus 1
From the creation to the cross   
There from the cross into eternity
Your grace finds me
Your grace finds me

Verse 3
It's there on a wedding day
There in the weeping by the graveside
There in the very breath we breathe
Your great grace

Verse 4
The same for the rich and poor
The same for the saint and for the sinner
Enough for this whole wide world
Your great grace oh, such grace

Chorus 2
  From the creation to the cross   
  There from the cross into eternity
Your grace finds me
Your grace finds me
  There in the darkest night of the soul   
  There in the sweetest songs of victory
Your grace finds me
Your grace finds me

Your great grace oh, such grace
Your great grace oh, such grace
