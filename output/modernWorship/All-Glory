Verse 1
How great is Your love
That never gives up on me
Stronger than shame
Carries me back to You
Jesus, my Redeemer
You have made a way 

Chorus
All glory to God who is able
All power and praise
Forever the earth will proclaim
You are mighty, You are mighty

Verse 2
So great is Your love
It keeps all its promises
Unshak - able
Eternity rests in Your hands
Jesus, I surrender
Lead me in Your ways 

(Repeat Chorus 2x)

Bridge
Lift Him higher, He is mighty
Lift Him higher, He is God
