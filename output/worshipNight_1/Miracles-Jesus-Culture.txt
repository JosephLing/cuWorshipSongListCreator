Verse 1
The One who made the blind to see
is moving here in front of me, moving here in front of me
The One who made the deaf to hear
is silencing my every fear, silencing my every fear

Chorus
I believe in You, I believe in You
You're the God of miracles
I believe in You, I believe in You
You're the God of miracles

Verse 2
The One who does impossible
Is reaching out to make me whole
reaching out to make me whole
The One who put death in its place
His life is flowing through my veins
His life is flowing through my veins

Chorus
|2x|

Bridge
The God who was and is to come
the power of the Risen One
the God who brings the dead to life
You're the God of miracles! You're the God of miracles!
|2x|
